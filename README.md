# FBC_OS-Fan-Project
A retro-styled fictional operating system, inspired by Remedy’s Control universe.   This project simulates what an internal FBC computer terminal could look and feel like:   CRT aesthetics, documents, audio logs, hotline archives, maps, altered items…   It is both a playable lore archive and an interactive fan experiment
